# where2p

An app to help you find the closest public restroom.

## Getting started

This app requires Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.1.4.

Once you have Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.1.4 installed,

 * `git clone https://github.com/marielfrank/where2p.git`
 * `cd where2p`
 * `bundle install`
 * `rails s`

## Road Map

A few things that are in the works:
    - Integrating Google Maps functionality
    - Collapsing the right-hand nav for a cleaner interface
    - Add more fun imagery
